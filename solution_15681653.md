## Data Plot
![Correlation between WO and Beer Consumption](correlation_plot.png)

### Interpretation
The scatter plot shows a positive correlation between WO [x1000] and NL Beer Consumption [x1000 hectoliter]. As the WO values increase, beer consumption tends to rise, suggesting a relationship between these variables. The trend, while generally upward, is not perfectly linear, indicating other factors might also influence beer consumption.
