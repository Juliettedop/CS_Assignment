## Data Plot
![Correlation between WO and Beer Consumption](correlation_plot.png)

### Interpretation Data
The plot shows the trends of WO (red line) and NL beer consumption (blue line) over the period from 2006 to 2018. WO and NL beer consumption both increases. This parallel growth suggests that as WO values increase, beer consumption tends to rise as well. This could be a possible correlation.
